<p>A Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) is a person responsible for conducting clinical trials using good clinical practice[1] (GCP) under the auspices of a Principal Investigator (PI).

Good clinical practices principles have been defined by Madelene Ottosen, RN, MSN, of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston [2] as:</p>
<ul><li>Trials are conducted ethically, as defined by the Declaration of Helsinki, rigorously, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines (ICH)</li>
<li>Benefits outweigh risks for each patient.</li>
<li>Rights, safety and well-being of patients prevail over science.</li>
<li>All available non-clinical and clinical information on any investigational agent can support the trial as designed.</li>
<li>All trials are scientifically sound and clearly described.</li>
<li>All clinical trials have current Institutional Review Board approval.</li>
<li>Medical decisions and care are the responsibility of qualified health care professionals, specifically physicians and, if applicable, dentists.</li>
<li>Everyone involved in the clinical trial is qualified by training, education and experience.</li>
<li>Informed consent is given freely by every participant.</li>
<li>All study documentation is recorded, handled and stored to allow accurate reporting, interpretation and verification.</li>
<li>Confidentiality of subjects is respected and protected.</li>
<li>Investigational products maintain Good Manufacturing Practice in storage, manufacturing and handling.</li>
