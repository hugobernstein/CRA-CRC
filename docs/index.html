<h1>About CRA and CRC</h1>
<article><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A clinical research associate (CRA), also called a clinical monitor or trial monitor, is a health-care professional who performs many activities related to medical research, particularly clinical trials. Clinical research associates work in various settings, such as pharmaceutical companies, medical research institutes and government agencies.[1][2] Depending on the jurisdiction, different education and certification requirements may be necessary to practice as a clinical research associate.

The main tasks of the CRA are defined by good clinical practice guidelines for monitoring clinical trials, such as those elaborated by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).</p>

<p>A Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) is a person responsible for conducting clinical trials using good clinical practice[1] (GCP) under the auspices of a Principal Investigator (PI).

Good clinical practices principles have been defined by Madelene Ottosen, RN, MSN, of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston [2] as:</p>
<ul><li>Trials are conducted ethically, as defined by the Declaration of Helsinki, rigorously, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines (ICH)</li>
<li>Benefits outweigh risks for each patient.</li>
<li>Rights, safety and well-being of patients prevail over science.</li>
<li>All available non-clinical and clinical information on any investigational agent can support the trial as designed.</li>
<li>All trials are scientifically sound and clearly described.</li>
<li>All clinical trials have current Institutional Review Board approval.</li>
<li>Medical decisions and care are the responsibility of qualified health care professionals, specifically physicians and, if applicable, dentists.</li>
<li>Everyone involved in the clinical trial is qualified by training, education and experience.</li>
<li>Informed consent is given freely by every participant.</li>
<li>All study documentation is recorded, handled and stored to allow accurate reporting, interpretation and verification.</li>
<li>Confidentiality of subjects is respected and protected.</li>
<li>Investigational products maintain Good Manufacturing Practice in storage, manufacturing and handling.</li>
<li>Systems to ensure quality are implemented in all aspects of the trial.</li></ul>
